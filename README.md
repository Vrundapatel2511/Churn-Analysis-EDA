Customer churn analysis is a data-driven project that focuses on understanding and reducing customer attrition or churn within a business. This project uses a dataset containing customer data and churn information to gain insights, perform data cleaning, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to identify factors contributing to churn and develop retention strategies.

# The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
  
# The churn analysis project involves the following key steps:
1. Data Loading
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
3. Missing Data Handling
4. Feature Engineering
5. Data Visualization and Analysis
6. Data Preprocessing
7. Conclusion

# Project Status
This project is complete and has provided valuable insights into customer churn within the dataset. Further actions and strategies can be developed based on these insights to improve customer retention.
