## Churn-Analysis
Customer churn analysis is a data-driven project that focuses on understanding and reducing customer attrition or churn within a business. This project uses a dataset containing customer data and churn information to gain insights, perform data cleaning, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models to identify factors contributing to churn and develop retention strategies.

1. Dataset: The project starts by loading and exploring the dataset.
- Importing necessary libraries (NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
- Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
- Checking the structure of the data, including its shape, columns, and data types.

2. Data Cleaning: Data cleaning involves handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
- Identifying and handling missing values.
- Converting the 'TotalCharges' column to a numeric data type.
- Creating a new column 'tenure_group' to categorize customers based on their tenure.
- Removing unnecessary columns like 'customerID' and 'tenure' for further analysis.
  
3. Data Exploration and Visualization: This section explores the dataset's variables and relationships between them.
- Analyzing the relationship between monthly charges and total charges.
- Building a correlation matrix and identifying factors correlated with churn.
  
4. Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing steps include converting categorical variables into dummy variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.

5. Bivariate Analysis: This section explores the relationships between variables and churn. 
- Analyzing the distribution of gender, payment methods, contract types, tech support, and senior citizen status for churned and non-churned customers.
